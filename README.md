# dotfiles

Some of my dotfiles that I use on linux machines. Buyer beware ;)

## Setup

### Install by script

The easiest way to install all dotfiles is to run the setup.sh script:
```bash
chmod u+x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

### Manual install

Just create symlinks between cloned repository and your home directory...
